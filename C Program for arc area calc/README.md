This program defines a structure called Arc that has two fields: radius and angle. It also defines a function called calcArcArea that takes an Arc structure as an argument and returns the area of the arc.

In the main function, the program declares an Arc structure with a radius of 10cm and an angle of 180 degrees. It then calls the calcArcArea function to calculate the area of the arc and prints the result to the console.
